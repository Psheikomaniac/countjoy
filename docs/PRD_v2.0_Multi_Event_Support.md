# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## CountJoy v2.0 - Multi-Event Support

### Executive Summary
CountJoy v2.0 introduces comprehensive multi-event management capabilities, transforming the app from a single-event countdown to a powerful event organization system. This version enables users to manage multiple countdowns simultaneously with intuitive navigation and organization features.

### Problem Statement
Current users can only track one event at a time, requiring them to manually switch between events or use multiple apps. This limitation reduces user engagement and prevents the app from becoming a comprehensive countdown solution for all life events.

### Goals & Objectives
- **Primary Goal:** Enable users to manage unlimited events simultaneously
- **Success Metrics:**
  - 75% of users create 3+ events within first week
  - 90% user retention after 30 days
  - 4.5+ star rating maintenance
  - <2 seconds load time for 50+ events

### User Stories

#### As a busy professional
- I want to track multiple deadlines simultaneously
- I want to prioritize events by importance
- I want to quickly search through my events
- I want to categorize work vs personal events

#### As a family organizer
- I want to track all family birthdays and anniversaries
- I want to create recurring annual events
- I want to share event countdowns with family members
- I want to see all upcoming events at a glance

### Functional Requirements

#### Event Management
1. **Event CRUD Operations**
   - Create unlimited events with unique titles
   - Update event details (title, date, time, category)
   - Delete events with confirmation dialog
   - Duplicate events for similar countdowns

2. **Event List View**
   - Display all events in scrollable list
   - Show mini countdown for each event
   - Visual indicator for event proximity (color coding)
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Lazy loading for performance (load 20 events at a time)

3. **Event Categories**
   - Pre-defined categories: Birthday, Anniversary, Holiday, Deadline, Meeting, Travel, Custom
   - Category icons and colors
   - Filter events by category
   - Category-based statistics

4. **Event Prioritization**
   - Three priority levels: High, Medium, Low
   - Visual indicators (stars, colors, badges)
   - Sort by priority option
   - Priority-based notifications

5. **Search & Filter**
   - Real-time search by title
   - Filter by category, priority, date range
   - Advanced filters: past events, upcoming week/month
   - Save filter presets

6. **Event Templates**
   - Create templates from existing events
   - Pre-built templates for common events
   - Template marketplace (future consideration)
   - Quick event creation from templates

### Technical Requirements

#### Database Schema
```kotlin
data class Event(
    val id: String = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
    val title: String,
    val targetDate: LocalDateTime,
    val category: EventCategory,
    val priority: Priority,
    val color: String,
    val isRecurring: Boolean = false,
    val recurringPattern: RecurringPattern? = null,
    val createdAt: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(),
    val updatedAt: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(),
    val isArchived: Boolean = false,
    val notes: String? = null,
    val reminders: List<Reminder> = emptyList()
)

enum class EventCategory {
    BIRTHDAY, ANNIVERSARY, HOLIDAY, DEADLINE, 
    MEETING, TRAVEL, FITNESS, EDUCATION, CUSTOM
}

enum class Priority {
    HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
}

data class RecurringPattern(
    val type: RecurrenceType,
    val interval: Int,
    val endDate: LocalDateTime? = null,
    val occurrences: Int? = null
)

enum class RecurrenceType {
    DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY
}
```

#### Performance Requirements
- Handle 1000+ events without lag
- List scrolling at 60 FPS
- Search results in <100ms
- App launch in <2 seconds
- Memory usage <100MB for 1000 events

#### UI/UX Requirements

##### Event List Screen
- Material Design 3 components
- Adaptive layouts for tablets
- Dark mode support
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Haptic feedback for interactions

##### Navigation Patterns
- Bottom navigation: Events, Add, Settings
- Swipe gestures for quick actions
- Long-press for context menu
- FAB for quick event creation

##### Visual Design
- Consistent color palette
- Typography hierarchy
- Iconography system
- Loading states and empty states
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Security
- Local data encryption for sensitive events
- Biometric lock for app access (optional)
- Secure backup mechanism

#### Accessibility
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode
- Adjustable text sizes
- Keyboard navigation support

#### Localization
- Support for 10 initial languages
- RTL layout support
- Date/time format localization
- Currency support for financial deadlines

### Dependencies & Constraints
- Android 7.0+ (API 24+)
- Room database for local storage
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Kotlin Coroutines for async operations
- Material Design 3 guidelines

### Migration Strategy
1. Automatic migration of existing single event
2. Tutorial for new multi-event features
3. Backward compatibility for 2 versions
4. Data export option before migration

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: 80% code coverage
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing with 1000+ events
- Accessibility testing
- Multi-device testing (phones, tablets)

### Release Criteria
- All functional requirements implemented
- Performance benchmarks met
- No critical bugs
- 95% crash-free rate in beta
- Localization for 5 core languages

### Future Considerations
- Cloud sync capability
- Web companion app
- Collaborative events
- AI-powered event suggestions
- Integration with calendar apps

### Timeline
- Development: 8-10 weeks
- Beta testing: 2 weeks
- Production release: Week 12

### Risk Assessment
- **Data migration failures:** Mitigate with extensive testing and rollback mechanism
- **Performance degradation:** Implement pagination and caching strategies
- **User confusion:** Provide comprehensive onboarding and help system
- **Database corruption:** Regular auto-backups and integrity checks

### Success Metrics (Post-Launch)
- DAU increase by 40%
- Average events per user: 5+
- Feature adoption rate: 60% within first month
- User satisfaction score: 4.5+
- Crash rate: <0.5%
