## CountJoy v2.5 - Smart Notifications & Alerts

### Executive Summary
CountJoy v2.5 introduces an intelligent notification system that keeps users engaged with their events through customizable alerts, smart reminders, and milestone notifications. This version transforms passive countdown viewing into active event anticipation.

### Problem Statement
Users often forget to check their countdown app, missing important milestones and reducing engagement. Without timely reminders, the emotional connection to upcoming events diminishes, and users may resort to traditional calendar apps for notifications.

### Goals & Objectives
- **Primary Goal:** Increase user engagement through intelligent notifications
- **Success Metrics:**
  - 85% notification opt-in rate
  - 3x increase in daily app opens
  - 70% of users customize notification settings
  - <1% notification-related uninstalls

### User Stories

#### As an event planner
- I want milestone notifications (30, 7, 1 day before)
- I want different notification sounds for different events
- I want to snooze notifications temporarily
- I want quiet hours for non-urgent events

#### As a forgetful user
- I want persistent notifications for critical events
- I want increasing frequency as events approach
- I want notification previews with countdown info
- I want to reschedule events from notifications

### Functional Requirements

1. **Milestone Notifications**
   - Automatic triggers: 365, 180, 90, 60, 30, 14, 7, 3, 1 days
   - Custom milestone configuration
   - Percentage-based milestones (50%, 25%, 10% remaining)
   - Hour-based for imminent events (24h, 12h, 6h, 1h)

2. **Smart Reminders**
   - AI-suggested reminder times based on event type
   - Adaptive scheduling based on user interaction patterns
   - Context-aware notifications (location, time of day)
   - Bundled notifications for multiple events

3. **Custom Notifications**
   - User-defined reminder schedules
   - Repeating reminders (daily, weekly)
   - Multiple reminders per event
   - Reminder templates for event types

4. **Notification Actions**
   - Quick view countdown from notification
   - Snooze options (1h, 3h, 1 day, custom)
   - Mark as seen/acknowledged
   - Share event from notification
   - Open event details

- Progress bar showing time remaining
- Event category icons
- Custom notification colors
- Grouped notifications by category

#### In-App Notification Center
- History of sent notifications
- Missed notification recovery

### Advanced Features

#### Smart Notification Engine
```kotlin
class SmartNotificationEngine {
    fun suggestOptimalTimes(event: Event): List<LocalDateTime> {
        // ML-based suggestion algorithm
        return when(event.category) {
            BIRTHDAY -> generateBirthdayReminders(event)
            DEADLINE -> generateDeadlineReminders(event)
            TRAVEL -> generateTravelReminders(event)
            else -> generateDefaultReminders(event)
        }
    }
    
    fun adaptToUserBehavior(interactions: List<NotificationInteraction>) {
        // Learn from user's notification interactions
        // Adjust timing and frequency accordingly
    }
}
```

#### Notification Templates
```kotlin
data class NotificationTemplate(
    val name: String,
    val category: EventCategory,
    val milestones: List<Duration>,
    val messageTemplate: String,
    val priority: NotificationPriority,
    val soundProfile: SoundProfile
)

// Pre-built templates
val templates = listOf(
    NotificationTemplate(
        name = "Birthday Reminder",
        category = BIRTHDAY,
        milestones = listOf(7.days, 1.day, 2.hours),
        messageTemplate = "üéÇ {name}'s birthday in {time}!",
        priority = HIGH,
        soundProfile = CHEERFUL
    ),

        name = "Deadline Alert",
        category = DEADLINE,
        milestones = listOf(3.days, 1.day, 6.hours, 1.hour),
        messageTemplate = "‚è∞ {title} due in {time}",
        priority = MAX,
